E-cigarette battery project
-----------------



### What it is?
A cheap alternative to expensive e-cigarette batteries. 
Supports all features of modern e-cigarettes such as VariVolt and VariWatt.

### How it works?
Simple algorithms calculate the voltage that must be applied to the coil using a transistor.
With the buttons we can choose the battery power that is displayed on the screen

### What we need?
The project requires several elements (have plans to develop a circuit board):
* High-voltage 18650 accumulator
* OLED display from Aliexpress
* Charging module
* MOSFET transitor (i use IRF3205)
* Arduino nano or only atmega328p for minimize size
